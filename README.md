# City Life Scores
Hello, this is my third project on <a href="https://www.start2impact.it/">start2impact</a>.

The purpose is to make it easy to access to life scores on a chosen city of interest. In order to do so, an API was used. The external service used here is <a href="https://developers.teleport.org/api/">Teleport</a>.

You can try this project <a href="https://city-pollution-s2i.netlify.app/">here</a>.

# How to use
This project is so easy to use. You have to add your favourite city in the search bar and city's scores will appear.

Information included is a little summary and these scores of:
- Housing
- Cost of Living
- Startups
- Venture Capital
- Travel Connectivity
- Commute
- Business Freedom
- Safety
- Healthcare
- Education
- Environmental Quality
- Economy
- Taxation
- Internet Access
- Leisure & Culture
- Tolerance
- Outdoors

p.s. Pay attention, you can't find all city. This doesn't depend on my project, but on the external service used and the material they provide.


# About the code
In this code you can see my first approach to an API.

I used CSS and some Bootstrap to fixed a little bit of style, but for the majority of the code I used JavaScript.
