# City Life Scores
Hello, this is my third project on <a href="https://www.start2impact.it/">start2impact</a>.

The purpose is to make it easy to access to life scores on a chosen city of interest. In order to do so, an API was used. The external service used here is <a href="https://developers.teleport.org/api/">Teleport</a>.

You can try this project <a href="">here</a>.

# How to use
This project is so easy to use. You have to add your favourite city in the search bar and city's scores will appear.

Information included is a little summary and these scores of:
<ol>Housing
<ol>Cost of Living
<ol>Startups
<ol>Venture Capital
<ol>Travel Connectivity
<ol>Commute
<ol>Business Freedom
<ol>Safety
<ol>Healthcare
<ol>Education
<ol>Environmental Quality
<ol>Economy
<ol>Taxation
<ol>Internet Access
<ol>Leisure & Culture
<ol>Tolerance
<ol>Outdoors

p.s. Pay attention, you can't find all city. This doesn't depend on my project, but on the external service used and the material they provide.


# About the code
In this code you can see my first approach to an API.

I used CSS and some Bootstrap to fixed a little bit of style, but for the majority of the code I used JavaScript.
